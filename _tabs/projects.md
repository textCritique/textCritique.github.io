I have worked on few projects, but only few are worth mentioning.

First something that is dear to my heart- raytracing.

## Very Basic Ray Tracer

I have written very basic ray tracer (or vbrt) in **OCaml**. I have already described the theory and design in README as well as pdf. You can get the [PDF](/assets/pdf/raytracer.pdf) directly.

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Induaditya3/computer_graphics_ocaml/tree/main/ray_tracer)

Here is a demo video:

## Teleporter Game

It is a very basic game implemented in pygame. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Induaditya3/pygame/blob/main/project/src/main.py).

Here is a video of gameplay:

{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='/assets/video/teleporter.mp4'
  types='mp4'
  poster='/assets/images/teleporter_game.png'
  title='Teleporter gameplay'
  autoplay=false
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}
