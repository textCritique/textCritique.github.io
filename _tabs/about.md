## Brief

I am neither mind nor body. I am pure consciousness bliss. 

Joke aside. I am a mediocre computer science undergrad.

## Interests : Past and Present

My past interest include physics and astronomy (mainly due to pop science). Back then I wanted to become cosmologist and study the black holes. But now all I want is to gain enough skill to employed at job that does not suck. 
Some of the new interests include computer graphics, formal verification and functional programming. Unlike most compsci undergrad, I have little to no interest in AI or any of its subfields. Image generation models might be an exception. I just want to understand enough of it so that I can build one myself from scratch. And I know this "want" is never going to materialize because it does not just require technical know-how but copious amount of high-quality data, not mention the vast computing resources which I will probably never have access to.   

Whenever I am bored but do not feel like watching content, I explore syntax, i.e., new programming languages. Hence the name of the blog: *Wandering Syntax*. 
I am not claiming to be pro level in any language but I know enough Python, C and OCaml to write non-trivial programs in them. I also know Javascript, R and Lean. But I forget those because I do not use them regularly.

In my free time I like to watch anime and web series. Some of the memorable ones include "Samurai Champloo", "Heavenly Delusion", "Hell's Paradise", "Garden of Words", "Silicon Valley" and "True Detective Season:1". (These are the ones that I listed off the top of my head.)
I also watch movies but since they are so short and ephemeral I do not remember their names. But I can tell you my favorite movie franchise - "Pirates of Caribbean". Except for one or two movies, all of them were thoroughly enjoyable. I also enjoyed "Pulp fiction" and "Lost in Translation" (I was able recall their name because I have watched theses multiple times often with spaced repetition.)
