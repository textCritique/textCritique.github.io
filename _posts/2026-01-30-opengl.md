**Computer graphics** is a process of generating images using a computer. Images can be realistic imitations to piecharts and everything in between, including graphical user interfaces.

It is a subfield of *visual computing*. Visual computing, aka image informatics, is a field that deals with both *image analysis* and *image synthesis*. 

In perspective projection, what is visible to the camera(or eye) can be modeled as frustum (apex chopped off a rectangular pyramid).
